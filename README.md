# RulesEngine

项目fork自 [RulesEngine](http://rulesengine.codeplex.com) - [athoma13](http://www.codeplex.com/site/users/view/athoma13).

Rules Engine is a . NET C# project that validates business logic by defining a bunch of rules for your data classes. Rules are defined using a fluent-interface (fluent validation) helper class, and not by decorating your existing objects with attributes, therefore de-coupling validation logic from data (or domain) classes. via [RulesEngine](http://rulesengine.codeplex.com)

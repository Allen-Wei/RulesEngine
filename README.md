# RulesEngine
Rules Engine is a . NET C# project that validates business logic by defining a bunch of rules for your data classes. Rules are defined using a fluent-interface (fluent validation) helper class, and not by decorating your existing objects with attributes, therefore de-coupling validation logic from data (or domain) classes. via http://rulesengine.codeplex.com/
